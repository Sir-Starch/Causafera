# Benchmarks

This document defines benchmark methodology and requirements for Ontopolis.

## Benchmark Requirements

Every performance-sensitive system must have:

- defined workload;
- reproducible setup;
- warm-up phase;
- measurement duration;
- statistical reporting (mean, median, stddev);
- hardware specification;
- deterministic mode verification.

## Workload Definitions

### Simulation Throughput Benchmark

Measure simulated days per wall-clock second under:

- minimal world (empty geography);
- small settlement (100 residents);
- medium city (10,000 residents);
- large region (100,000 residents).

### Observer Overhead Benchmark

Measure performance with:

- no observer;
- idle observer;
- normal UI load;
- heavy inspection load.

### Explanation Query Benchmark

Measure Explanation Engine latency for:

- simple entity lookup;
- causal trace reconstruction (10 hops);
- causal trace reconstruction (100 hops);
- phenomenon classification.

## GPU Benchmarks

Every GPU kernel requires:

1. CPU reference implementation;
2. Defined inputs;
3. Defined outputs;
4. Correctness tests;
5. Transfer-inclusive benchmark;
6. Workload crossover measurement.

## Reporting

Benchmark results must be:

- stored in version control;
- compared across commits;
- flagged on regression;
- reproducible on reference hardware.

## Reference Hardware

- Linux;
- x86-64;
- Ryzen 9 7950X3D-class CPU;
- 64 GB RAM;
- RTX 4080 Super-class GPU;
- NVIDIA CUDA.
